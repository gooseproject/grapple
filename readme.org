#+TITLE: Grapple README

* Overview

Grapple is a tool to respond to [[http://help.github.com/post-receive-hooks/][Github post-receive hooks]] and then
kick off a package build in Koji.  The main portion of the tool is a
webservice that responds to POST requests from github, a query about
builds that need to be submitted, and an action to update the status
of a given build.  A unique build is a given commit on a given
branch.

* Requirements

Python >= 2.5
web.py

For database setup:
sqlite3

For test purposes:
curl

* Quick setup for testing
** This process will be moved to a Makefile soon

** Download test data
*** edit tests/grab_test_data.py and fill in the POSTBIN url for the sample requests
*** cd tests && python grab_test_data.py
** create the sqlite database
*** [ -f grappledb ] && rm grappledb ; sqlite grappledb < schema.sql
** start the server
*** python grapple.py
** Try adding commits
*** cd tests && for i in *.json; do curl -X POST -d @$i http://localhost:8080/add; done
** Query for commits
*** curl http://localhost:8080/getcommits
** Change the state to successfully submitted on a few
*** for i in 1 3 5 6; do curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/submitted/$i; done
** Query for commits
*** curl http://localhost:8080/getcommits

* Upcoming tasks and plans

In no particular order or guarantee, here are possible improvements
and refinements to Grapple:

** TODO Create Makefile to automate testing and setup
** TODO Have index return an API summary.
** TODO Have grapple.py read configuration from a configuration file
*** defaults: limit, ip_whitelist, etc
*** database connection information
** TODO Review for needed error handling
** TODO Add logging
** TODO Make a decorator to limit a url from being called from just whitelists
** TODO Become more PEP8 compliant
** TODO Add license and copyright header in source
** TODO Move status definition to DB?
** TODO For methods not returning data, what's the proper output?
** TODO Verify the build has not already been seen before adding
** TODO Create init scripts
** TODO Create RPMs
